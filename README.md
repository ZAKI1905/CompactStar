# CompactStar

**CompactStar** is a modular C++ framework for modeling the structure of compact stars, including neutron stars and dark-visible admixed configurations.  
It supports both tabulated and analytical equations of state (EOS), and includes solvers for the Tolmanâ€“Oppenheimerâ€“Volkoff (TOV) and Hartle equations.

The code is designed for flexibility and extensibility, with integrated modules for physics, mathematics, file I/O, and analysis of astrophysical data.

## Features

- Supports tabulated and analytical EOS formats
- Solves relativistic stellar structure equations (TOV & Hartle)
- Models hybrid stars with visible and dark matter
- Built-in support for sequences, contours, and profile exports
- Lightweight dependencies (GSL, C++17)
- Modular structure for easy extension
