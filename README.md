CompactStar is a modular C++ framework for modeling the structure of compact stars, including neutron stars and hybrid dark-visible configurations. It supports both tabulated and analytical equations of state, and includes solvers for the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) and Hartle equations. The code is optimized for flexibility, with integrated math, I/O, and analysis tools for astrophysical applications.
